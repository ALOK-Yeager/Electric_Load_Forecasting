# How to Create a Telegram Bot Using BotFather

This guide walks you through creating a Telegram bot using BotFather, Telegram’s official bot management tool. No coding or technical knowledge is needed for this part—just follow these steps in the Telegram app.

## What You’ll Need
- A Telegram account (download the Telegram app or use the web version at https://web.telegram.org).
- A phone or computer with Telegram installed.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open Telegram and Find BotFather
1. Open the Telegram app on your phone or computer.
2. Tap or click the search icon (a magnifying glass, usually at the top).
3. Type `@BotFather` in the search bar.
4. Look for the account named “BotFather” with a blue checkmark next to it (this shows it’s the official Telegram bot).
   - **What you’ll see**: A list of search results. The top result should be “BotFather” with a blue checkmark and a description saying it’s for creating and managing bots.

### Step 2: Start a Chat with BotFather
1. Tap or click on @BotFather to open a chat.
2. Press the “Start” button at the bottom of the chat window.
   - **What you’ll see**: A message from BotFather listing commands like `/start`, `/newbot`, `/mybots`, etc., in a vertical list. Each command has a short description, like “create a new bot” next to `/newbot`.

### Step 3: Create a New Bot
1. In the chat, type `/newbot` and send it by pressing the send button (usually a paper airplane icon).
   - **What you’ll see**: BotFather replies with, “Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.”

### Step 4: Name Your Bot
1. Type a name for your bot (e.g., “MyCoolBot”) and send it. This is the display name people will see when they chat with your bot.
   - **What you’ll see**: BotFather responds with, “Good. Now let’s choose a username for your bot. It must end in ‘bot’. Like this, for example: @TetrisBot or @tetris_bot.”

### Step 5: Choose a Username
1. Type a unique username starting with `@` and ending with “bot” (e.g., `@MyCoolBot`). It should only use English letters, numbers, or underscores.
2. Send the username.
   - **What you’ll see**: 
     - If the username is available, BotFather replies with, “Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/MyCoolBot. You can now add a description, about section, and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands.” It also shows a token (a long string of letters and numbers, like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-xyz`).
     - If the username is taken, BotFather says, “Sorry, that username is already taken. Please try something different.” Try a new username until one works.

### Step 6: Save Your Bot’s Token
1. Copy the token BotFather sent (the long string of letters and numbers).
2. Paste it somewhere safe, like a private note or document. Treat it like a password—don’t share it!
   - **What you’ll see**: The token is part of BotFather’s message, usually highlighted or easy to select. It looks something like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-xyz`.

### Step 7: Test Your Bot
1. Tap or click the link in BotFather’s message (e.g., `t.me/MyCoolBot`) to open a chat with your new bot.
2. Press the “Start” button in your bot’s chat.
   - **What you’ll see**: A new chat window with your bot’s name at the top (e.g., “MyCoolBot”). Since you haven’t added features yet, the bot won’t respond to messages beyond a basic start.

### Step 8: Customize Your Bot (Optional)
1. Go back to the BotFather chat.
2. Type `/setdescription` to add a short description (e.g., “This bot helps with reminders!”).
3. Follow BotFather’s prompts to select your bot and send the description.
   - **What you’ll see**: BotFather asks, “Please choose a bot to change the description for,” with a button for your bot’s username. After sending the description, BotFather confirms, “Success! Description updated.”
4. Type `/setuserpic` to add a profile picture. Send a photo when prompted.
   - **What you’ll see**: BotFather asks for a photo file. After sending one, it confirms, “Success! Profile picture updated.”

### Step 9: Next Steps
Your bot is now created but doesn’t do much yet—it’s like an empty shell. To make it respond to messages or perform tasks, you can:
- Use a no-code platform like ManyChat or SendPulse to add features without programming.
- Learn basic coding (e.g., Python or Node.js) to program custom responses using the token you saved.
- Explore BotFather’s other commands by typing `/help` to see options like setting commands or enabling inline mode.

## Important Tips
- Keep your token private. If someone gets it, they can control your bot. Use `/revoke` in BotFather to generate a new token if needed.
- If you want to delete your bot, type `/deletebot` in BotFather and follow the prompts.
- To see all your bots, type `/mybots` in BotFather.

Congratulations! You’ve created your first Telegram bot. You can now share its link (e.g., `t.me/MyCoolBot`) with others or add it to groups.
